	abstract = {By examining “who connects with whom” in an online community using social network analysis, this study tests the social drivers that shape the collaboration dynamics among a group of participants from SourceForge, the largest open source community on the Web. The formation of the online social network was explored by testing two distinct network attachment logics: strategic selection and homophily. Both logics received some support. Taken together, the results are suggestive of a “performance-based clustering” phenomenon within the OSS online community in which most collaborations involve accomplished developers, and novice developers tend to partner with less accomplished and less experienced peers.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning: is the process of translating quality predictors learned in one data set to another. Transfer learning has been the subject of much recent research. In practice, that research means changing models all the time as transfer learners continually exchange new models to the current project. This paper offers a very simple bellwether transfer learner. Given N data sets, we find which one produce the best predictions on all the others. This bellwether data set is then used for all subsequent predictions (or, until such time as its predictions start failing-- at which point it is wise to seek another bellwether). Bellwethers are interesting since they are very simple to find (just wrap a for-loop around standard data miners). Also, they simplify the task of making general policies in SE since as long as one bellwether remains useful, stable conclusions for N data sets can be achieved just by reasoning over that bellwether. From this, we conclude (1) this bellwether method is a useful (and very simple) transfer learning method; (2) bellwethers are a baseline method against which future transfer learners should be compared; (3) sometimes, when building increasingly complex automatic methods, researchers should pause and compare their supposedly more sophisticated method against simpler alternatives.},

abstract="This paper examines the theoretical and practical problems that arise from attempts to develop formal characterizations and explanations of many work activities, in particular, collaborative activities. We argue that even seemingly discrete individual activities occur in, and frequently draw upon a complex network of factors: individual, social and organizational. Similarly, organizational and social constraints and practices impact upon individual cognitive processes and the realization of these in specific tasks. Any adequate characterization of work activities therefore requires the analysis and synthesis of information from these traditionally separate sources. We argue that existing frameworks, emanating separately from the respective disciplines (cognitive, social and organizational) do not present an adequate means of studying the dynamics of collaborative activity in situ. An alternative framework, advocated in this paper, is distributed cognition. Its theoretical basis is outlined together with examples of applied studies of computer-mediated work activities in different organizational settings.",

abstract="This paper provides an analysis of the behavior of separate-and-conquer or covering rule learning algorithms by visualizing their evaluation metrics and their dynamics in coverage space, a variant of ROC space. Our results show that most commonly used metrics, including accuracy, weighted relative accuracy, entropy, and Gini index, are equivalent to one of two fundamental prototypes: precision, which tries to optimize the area under the ROC curve for unknown costs, and a cost-weighted difference between covered positive and negative examples, which tries to find the optimal point under known or assumed costs. We also show that a straightforward generalization of the m-estimate trades off these two prototypes. Furthermore, our results show that stopping and filtering criteria like CN2's significance test focus on identifying significant deviations from random classification, which does not necessarily avoid overfitting. We also identify a problem with Foil's MDL-based encoding length restriction, which proves to be largely equivalent to a variable threshold on the recall of the rule. In general, we interpret these results as evidence that, contrary to common conception, pre-pruning heuristics are not very well understood and deserve more investigation.",

pages="225--245",
abstract="In rule discovery systems, learning often proceeds by first assessing the quality of the system's current rules and then modifying rules based on that assessment. This paper addresses the credit assignment problem that arises when long sequences of rules fire between successive external rewards. The focus is on the kinds of rule assessment schemes which have been proposed for rule discovery systems that use genetic algorithms as the primary rule modification strategy. Two distinct approaches to rule learning with genetic algorithms have been previously reported, each approach offering a useful solution to a different level of the credit assignment problem. We describe a system, called RUDI, that exploits both approaches. We present analytic and experimental results that support the hypothesis that multiple levels of credit assignment can improve the performance of rule learning systems based on genetic algorithms.",

abstract="SBSE researchers often use an evolutionary algorithm to solve various software engineering problems. This paper explores an alternate approach of sampling. This approach is called SWAY (Samplying WAY) and finds the (near) optimal solutions to the problem by (i) creating a larger initial population and (ii) intelligently sampling the solution space to find the best subspace. Unlike evolutionary algorithms, SWAY does not use mutation or cross-over or multi-generational reasoning to find interesting subspaces but relies on the underlying dimensions of the solution space. Experiments with Software Engineering (SE) models shows that SWAY's performance improvement is competitive with standard MOEAs while, terminating over an order of magnitude faster.",

abstract = {Automatic program repair has been a longstanding goal in software engineering, yet debugging remains a largely manual process. We introduce a fully automated method for locating and repairing bugs in software. The approach works on off-the-shelf legacy applications and does not require formal specifications, program annotations or special coding practices. Once a program fault is discovered, an extended form of genetic programming is used to evolve program variants until one is found that both retains required functionality and also avoids the defect in question. Standard test cases are used to exercise the fault and to encode program requirements. After a successful repair has been discovered, it is minimized using structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging. We describe the proposed method and report experimental results demonstrating that it can successfully repair ten different C programs totaling 63,000 lines in under 200 seconds, on average.},

 abstract = {Text retrieval approaches have been used to address many software engineering tasks. In most cases, their use involves issuing a textual query to retrieve a set of relevant software artifacts from the system. The performance of all these approaches depends on the quality of the given query (i.e., its ability to describe the information need in such a way that the relevant software artifacts are retrieved during the search). Currently, the only way to tell that a query failed to lead to the expected software artifacts is by investing time and effort in analyzing the search results. In addition, it is often very difficult to ascertain what part of the query leads to poor results. We propose a novel pre-retrieval metric, which reflects the quality of a query by measuring the specificity of its terms. We exemplify the use of the new specificity metric on the task of concept location in source code. A preliminary empirical study shows that our metric is a good effort predictor for text retrieval-based concept location, outperforming existing techniques from the field of natural language document retrieval.},

The size and variety of today's software artifacts and the multitude of stakeholder activities result in so much data that individuals can no longer reason about all of it. We argue in this position paper that data mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, information retrieval, data integration, etc., are necessary solutions to deal with software data. New research is needed to adapt existing algorithms and tools for software engineering data and processes, and new ones will have to be created.
In order for this type of research to succeed, it should be supported with new approaches to empirical work, where data and results are shared globally among researchers and practitioners. Software engineering researchers can get inspired by other fields, such as, bioinformatics, where results of mining and analyzing biological data are often stored in databases shared across the world.},

Much of this research has been focused on determining how to use various IR techniques to support concept location. Very little attention has been given to the effect of different configurations of corpus building and indexing on query results. In this paper, we propose a tool designed to support large-scale studies of IR techniques in varying configurations of parameters with the intention of automatically calibrating these parameters. We also discuss preliminary efforts to create the benchmark data such studies require.},

 pages = {1-10},
 abstract = {One of the most common comprehension activities undertaken by developers is concept location in source code. In the context of software change, concept location means finding locations in source code where changes are to be made in response to a modification request. Static techniques for concept location usually rely on searching the source code using textual information or on navigating the dependencies among software elements. In this paper we propose a novel static concept location technique, which leverages both the textual information present in the code and the structural dependencies between source code elements. The technique employs a textual search in that source code, which is clustered using the Border Flow algorithm, based on combining both structural and textual data. We evaluated the technique against a text search based baseline approach using data on almost 200 changes from five software systems. The results indicate that the new approach outperforms the baseline and that improvements are still possible.},

The formation of the online social network was explored by testing two distinct network attachment logics: strategic selection and homophily. Both logics received some support. Taken together, the results are suggestive of a “performance-based clustering” phenomenon within the OSS online community in which most collaborations involve accomplished developers, and novice developers tend to partner with less accomplished and less experienced peers.},

abstract = {Many software defect prediction approaches have been proposed and most are effective in within-project prediction settings. However, for new projects or projects with limited training data, it is desirable to learn a prediction model by using sufficient training data from existing source projects and then apply the model to some target projects (cross-project defect prediction). Unfortunately, the performance of cross-project defect prediction is generally poor, largely because of feature distribution differences between the source and target projects. In this paper, we apply a state-of-the-art transfer learning approach, TCA, to make feature distributions in source and target projects similar. In addition, we propose a novel transfer defect learning approach, TCA+, by extending TCA. Our experimental results for eight open-source projects show that TCA+ significantly improves cross-project prediction performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Ma2012,
    abstract = {Context: Software defect prediction studies usually built
    models using within-company data, but very few focused on the prediction
    models trained with cross-company data. It is difficult to employ these
    models which are built on the within-company data in practice, because of
    the lack of these local data repositories. Recently, transfer learning has
    attracted more and more attention for building classifier in target domain
    using the data from related source domain. It is very useful in cases when
    distributions of training and test instances differ, but is it appropriate
    for cross-company software defect prediction? Objective: In this paper, we
    consider the cross-company defect prediction scenario where source and
    target data are drawn from different companies. In order to harness cross
    company data, we try to exploit the transfer learning method to build
    faster and highly effective prediction model. Method: Unlike the prior
    works selecting training data which are similar from the test data, we
    proposed a novel algorithm called Transfer Naive Bayes (TNB), by using the
    information of all the proper features in training data. Our solution
    estimates the distribution of the test data, and transfers cross-company
    data information into the weights of the training data. On these weighted
    data, the defect prediction model is built. Results: This article presents
    a theoretical analysis for the comparative methods, and shows the
    experiment results on the data sets from different organizations. It
    indicates that TNB is more accurate in terms of AUC (The area under the
    receiver operating characteristic curve), within less runtime than the
    state of the art methods. Conclusion: It is concluded that when there are
    too few local training data to train good classifiers, the useful
    knowledge from different-distribution training data on feature level may
    help. We are optimistic that our transfer learning method can guide
    optimal resource allocation strategies, which may reduce software testing
    cost and increase effectiveness of software testing process.

@article{vcboost16,
abstract = {It is well-known that software defect prediction is one of the
most important tasks for software quality improvement. The use of defect
predictors allows test engineers to focus on defective modules. Thereby
testing resources can be allocated effectively and the quality assurance
costs can be reduced. For within-project defect prediction (WPDP), there
should be sufficient data within a company to train any prediction model.
Without such local data, cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is feasible
since it uses data collected from similar projects in other companies.
Software defect datasets have the class imbalance problem increasing the
difficulty for the learner to predict defects. In addition, the impact of
imbalanced data on the real performance of models can be hidden by the
performance measures chosen. We investigate if the class imbalance learning
can be beneficial for CPDP. In our approach, the asymmetric
misclassification cost and the similarity weights obtained from
distributional characteristics are closely associated to guide the
appropriate resampling mechanism. We performed the effect size A-statistics
test to evaluate the magnitude of the improvement. For the statistical
significant test, we used Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The experimental results
show that our approach can provide higher prediction performance than both
the existing CPDP technique and the existing class imbalance technique.},

abstract="Software forges like GitHub host millions of repositories. Software engineering researchers have been able to take advantage of such a large corpora of potential study subjects with the help of tools like GHTorrent and Boa. However, the simplicity in querying comes with a caveat: there are limited means of separating the signal (e.g. repositories containing engineered software projects) from the noise (e.g. repositories containing home work assignments). The proportion of noise in a random sample of repositories could skew the study and may lead to researchers reaching unrealistic, potentially inaccurate, conclusions. We argue that it is imperative to have the ability to sieve out the noise in such large repository forges. We propose a framework, and present a reference implementation of the framework as a tool called reaper, to enable researchers to select GitHub repositories that contain evidence of an engineered software project. We identify software engineering practices (called dimensions) and propose means for validating their existence in a GitHub repository. We used reaper to measure the dimensions of 1,857,423 GitHub repositories. We then used manually classified data sets of repositories to train classifiers capable of predicting if a given GitHub repository contains an engineered software project. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using a set of 200 repositories with known ground truth classification. We also compared the performance of the classifiers to other approaches to classification (e.g. number of GitHub Stargazers) and found our classifiers to outperform existing approaches. We found stargazers-based classifier (with 10 as the threshold for number of stargazers) to exhibit high precision (97{\%}) but an inversely proportional recall (32{\%}). On the other hand, our best classifier exhibited a high precision (82{\%}) and a high recall (86{\%}). The stargazer-based criteria offers precision but fails to recall a significant portion of the population.",

abstract = "Context: Data miners have been widely used in software engineering to, say, generate defect predictors from static code measures. Such static code defect predictors perform well compared to manual methods, and they are easy to use and useful to use. But one of the “black arts” of data mining is setting the tunings that control the miner. Objective: We seek simple, automatic, and very effective method for finding those tunings. Method: For each experiment with different data sets (from open source JAVA systems), we ran differential evolution as an optimizer to explore the tuning space (as a first step) then tested the tunings using hold-out data. Results: Contrary to our prior expectations, we found these tunings were remarkably simple: it only required tens, not thousands, of attempts to obtain very good results. For example, when learning software defect predictors, this method can quickly find tunings that alter detection precision from 0\% to 60\%. Conclusion: Since (1) the improvements are so large, and (2) the tuning is so simple, we need to change standard methods in software analytics. At least for defect prediction, it is no longer enough to just run a data miner and present the result without conducting a tuning optimization study. The implication for other kinds of analytics is now an open and pressing issue."

title="Negative results for software effort estimation",
journal="Empirical Software Engineering",
year="2016",
pages="1--26",
abstract="More than half the literature on software effort estimation (SEE) focuses on comparisons of new estimation methods. Surprisingly, there are no studies comparing state of the art latest methods with decades-old approaches. Accordingly, this paper takes five steps to check if new SEE methods generated better estimates than older methods. Firstly, collect effort estimation methods ranging from ``classical'' COCOMO (parametric estimation over a pre-determined set of attributes) to ``modern'' (reasoning via analogy using spectral-based clustering plus instance and feature selection, and a recent ``baseline method'' proposed in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering). Secondly, catalog the list of objections that lead to the development of post-COCOMO estimation methods. Thirdly, characterize each of those objections as a comparison between newer and older estimation methods. Fourthly, using four COCOMO-style data sets (from 1991, 2000, 2005, 2010) and run those comparisons experiments. Fifthly, compare the performance of the different estimators using a Scott-Knott procedure using (i) the A12 effect size to rule out ``small'' differences and (ii) a 99 {\%} confident bootstrap procedure to check for statistically different groupings of treatments. The major negative result of this paper is that for the COCOMO data sets, nothing we studied did any better than Boehms original procedure. Hence, we conclude that when COCOMO-style attributes are available, we strongly recommend (i) using that data and (ii) use COCOMO to generate predictions. We say this since the experiments of this paper show that, at least for effort estimation, how data is collected is more important than what learner is applied to that data.",

abstract     = {<p>In this paper, we present the results from two surveys
related to data science
applied to software engineering. The first survey solicited questions that
software engineers would like data scientists to investigate about software,
about software processes and practices, and about software engineers. Our
analyses resulted in a list of 145 questions grouped into 12 categories. The
second survey asked a different pool of software engineers to rate these 145
questions and identify the most important ones to work on first. Respondents
favored questions that focus on how customers typically use their
applications.
We also saw opposition to questions that assess the performance of
individual
employees or compare them with one another. Our categorization and catalog
of 145
questions can help researchers, practitioners, and educators to more easily
focus
their efforts on topics that are important to the software industry.</p>

abstract = {Several code smell detection tools have been developed providing different
results, because smells can be subjectively interpreted, and hence detected, in
different ways. In this paper, we perform the largest experiment of applying machine
learning algorithms to code smells to the best of our knowledge. We experiment 16
different machine-learning algorithms on four code smells (Data Class, Large Class,
Feature Envy, Long Method) and 74 software systems, with 1986 manually validated code
smell samples. We found that all algorithms achieved high performances in the
cross-validation data set, yet the highest performances were obtained by J48 and Random
Forest, while the worst performance were achieved by support vector machines. However,
the lower prevalence of code smells, i.e., imbalanced data, in the entire data set
caused varying performances that need to be addressed in the future studies. We
conclude that the application of machine learning to the detection of these code smells
can provide high accuracy ({\textgreater}96 {\%}), and only a hundred training examples
are needed to reach at least 95 {\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {Criteria for software quality measurement depend on the application area. In large software systems criteria like maintainability, comprehensibility and extensibility play an important role. My aim is to identify design flaws in software systems automatically and thus to avoid “bad” — incomprehensible, hardly expandable and changeable — program structures. Depending on the perception and experience of the searching engineer, design flaws are interpreted in a different way. I propose to combine known methods for finding design flaws on the basis of metrics with machine learning mechanisms, such that design flaw detection is adaptable to different views. This paper presents the underlying method, describes an analysis tool for Java programs and shows results of an initial case study. },

abstract = {It is well-known that software defect prediction is one of the
most important tasks for software quality improvement. The use of defect
predictors allows test engineers to focus on defective modules. Thereby
testing resources can be allocated effectively and the quality assurance
costs can be reduced. For within-project defect prediction (WPDP), there
should be sufficient data within a company to train any prediction model.
Without such local data, cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is feasible
since it uses data collected from similar projects in other companies.
Software defect datasets have the class imbalance problem increasing the
difficulty for the learner to predict defects. In addition, the impact of
imbalanced data on the real performance of models can be hidden by the
performance measures chosen. We investigate if the class imbalance learning
can be beneficial for CPDP. In our approach, the asymmetric
misclassification cost and the similarity weights obtained from
distributional characteristics are closely associated to guide the
appropriate resampling mechanism. We performed the effect size A-statistics
test to evaluate the magnitude of the improvement. For the statistical
significant test, we used Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The experimental results
show that our approach can provide higher prediction performance than both
the existing CPDP technique and the existing class imbalance technique.},

abstract = {When projects lack sufficient local data to make predictions, they try to transfer information from other projects. How can we best support this process? In the field of software engineering, transfer learning has been shown to be effective for defect prediction. This paper checks whether it is possible to build transfer learners for software effort estimation. We use data on 154 projects from 2 sources to investigate transfer learning between different time intervals and 195 projects from 51 sources to provide evidence on the value of transfer learning for traditional cross-company learning problems. We find that the same transfer learning method can be useful for transfer effort estimation results for the cross-company learning problem and the cross-time learning problem. It is misguided to think that: (1) Old data of an organization is irrelevant to current context or (2) data of another organization cannot be used for local solutions. Transfer learning is a promising research direction that transfers relevant cross data between time intervals and domains.},

However, for new projects or projects with limited training data, it is desirable to learn a prediction model by using sufficient training data from existing source projects and then apply the model to some target projects (cross-project defect prediction). Unfortunately, the performance of cross-project defect prediction is generally poor, largely because of feature distribution differences between the source and target projects. In this paper, we apply a state-of-the-art transfer learning approach, TCA, to make feature distributions in source and target projects similar. In addition, we propose a novel transfer defect learning approach, TCA+, by extending TCA. Our experimental results for eight open-source projects show that TCA+ significantly improves cross-project prediction performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used and the modelling techniques applied, influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method:We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesise the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modelling techniques such as Na{\"{\i}}ve Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology and performance comprehensively.},

abstract = {Before a community can learn general principles, it must share individual experiences. Data sharing is the fundamental step of cross project defect prediction, i.e. the process of using data from one project to predict for defects in another. Prior work on secure data sharing allowed data owners to share their data on a single-party basis for defect prediction via data minimization and obfuscation. However the studied method did not consider that bigger data required the data owner to share more of their data. In this paper, we extend previous work with LACE2 which reduces the amount of data shared by using multi-party data sharing. Here data owners incrementally add data to a cache passed among them and contribute "interesting" data that are not similar to the current content of the cache. Also, before data owner i passes the cache to data owner j, privacy is preserved by applying obfuscation algorithms to hide project details. The experiments of this paper show that (a) LACE2 is comparatively less expensive than the single-party approach and (b) the multi-party approach of LACE2 yields higher privacy than the prior approach without damaging predictive efficacy (indeed, in some cases, LACE2 leads to better defect predictors).},

abstract = {Context: Software defect prediction has been widely studied
based on various machine-learning algorithms. Previous studies usually
focus on within-company defects prediction (WCDP), but lack of training
data in the early stages of software testing limits the efficiency of WCDP
in practice. Thus, recent research has largely examined the cross-company
defects prediction (CCDP) as an alternative solution. Objective: However,
the gap of different distributions between cross-company (CC) data and
withincompany (WC) data usually makes it difficult to build a high-quality
CCDP model. In this paper, a novel algorithm named Double Transfer
Boosting (DTB) is introduced to narrow this gap and improve the
performance of CCDP by reducing negative samples in CC data. Method: The
proposed DTB model integrates two levels of data transfer: first, the data
gravitation method reshapes the whole distribution of CC data to fit WC
data. Second, the transfer boosting method employs a small ratio of
labeled WC data to eliminate negative instances in CC data. Results: The
empirical evaluation was conducted based on 15 publicly available
datasets. CCDP experiment results indicated that the proposed model
achieved better overall performance than compared CCDP models. DTB was
also compared to WCDP in two different situations. Statistical analysis
suggested that DTB performed significantly better than WCDP models trained
by limited samples and produced comparable results to WCDP with sufficient
training data. Conclusions: DTB reforms the distribution of CC data from
different levels to improve the performance of CCDP, and experimental
results and analysis demonstrate that it could be an effective model for
early software defects detection.},

Such static code defect predictors perform well compared to manual methods, and they are easy to use and useful to use. But one of the “black arts” of data mining is setting the tunings that control the miner. Objective: We seek simple, automatic, and very effective method for finding those tunings. Method: For each experiment with different data sets (from open source \{JAVA\} systems), we ran differential evolution as an optimizer to explore the tuning space (as a first step) then tested the tunings using hold-out data. Results: Contrary to our prior expectations, we found these tunings were remarkably simple: it only required tens, not thousands, of attempts to obtain very good results. For example, when learning software defect predictors, this method can quickly find tunings that alter detection precision from 0% to 60%. Conclusion: Since (1) the improvements are so large, and (2) the tuning is so simple, we need to change standard methods in software analytics. At least for defect prediction, it is no longer enough to just run a data miner and present the result without conducting a tuning optimization study. The implication for other kinds of analytics is now an open and pressing issue. "

abstract = {How can we find data for quality prediction? Early in the life
cycle, projects may lack the data needed to build such predictors. Prior
work assumed that relevant training data was found nearest to the local

filter which is based on the following conjecture: When local data is
scarce, more information exists in other projects. Accordingly, this
filter selects training data via the structure of other projects. To
assess the performance of the Peters filter, we compare it with two other
approaches for quality prediction. Within-company learning and
cross-company learning with the Burak filter (the state-of-the-art
relevancy filter). This paper finds that: 1) within-company predictors are
weak for small data-sets; 2) the Peters filter+cross-company builds better
predictors than both within-company and the Burak filter+cross-company;
and 3) the Peters filter builds 64{\%} more useful predictors than both
within-company and the Burak filter+cross-company approaches. Hence, we
recommend the Peters filter for cross-company learning. {\textcopyright}

This hierarchical decomposition has a profound influence on evolvability, maintainability and work assignment. Hierarchical decomposition is thus clearly of central concern for empirical software engineering researchers; but it also poses a quandary. At what level do we study phenomena, such as quality, distribution, collaboration and productivity? At the level of files? packages? or modules? How does the level of study affect the truth, meaning, and relevance of the findings? In other fields it has been found that choosing the wrong level might lead to misleading or fallacious results. Choosing a proper level, for study, is thus vitally important for empirical software engineering research; but this issue hasn't thus far been explicitly investigated. We describe the related idea of ecological inference and ecological fallacy from sociology and epidemiology, and explore its relevance to empirical software engineering; we also present some case studies, using defect and process data from 18 open source projects to illustrate the risks of modeling at an aggregation level in the context of defect prediction, as well as in hypothesis testing.},

abstract = {Background: Continuously calibrated and validated parametric models are necessary for realistic software estimates. However, in practice, variations in model adoption and usage patterns introduce a great deal of local bias in the resultant historical data. Such local bias should be carefully examined and addressed before the historical data can be used for calibrating new versions of parametric models. Aims: In this study, we aim at investigating the degree of such local bias in a cross-company historical dataset, and assessing its impacts on parametric estimation model's performance. Method: Our study consists of three parts: 1) defining a method for measuring and analyzing the local bias associated with individual organization data subset in the overall dataset; 2) assessing the impacts of local bias on the estimation performance of COCOMO II 2000 model; 3) performing a correlation analysis to verify that local bias can be harmful to the performance of a parametric estimation model. Results: Our results show that the local bias negatively impacts the performance of parametric model. Our measure of local bias has a positive correlation with the performance by statistical importance. Conclusion: Local calibration by using the whole multi-company data would get worse performance. The influence of multi-company data could be defined by local bias and be measured by our method.},

Such studies often exhibit conclusion instability regarding what is the most effective action for different projects or modules. This instability can be explained by data heterogeneity. We show that effort and defect data contain many local regions with markedly different properties to the global space. In other words, what appears to be useful in a global context is often irrelevant for particular local contexts. This result raises questions about the generality of conclusions from empirical SE. At the very least, SE researchers should test if their supposedly general conclusions are valid within subsets of their data. At the very most, empirical SE should become a search for local regions with similar properties (and conclusions should be constrained to just those regions).},

abstract = {Much research energy in software engineering is focused on the creation of effort and defect prediction models. Such models are important means for practitioners to judge their current project situation, optimize the allocation of their resources, and make informed future decisions. However, software engineering data contains a large amount of variability. Recent research demonstrates that such variability leads to poor fits of machine learning models to the underlying data, and suggests splitting datasets into more fine-grained subsets with similar properties. In this paper, we present a comparison of three different approaches for creating statistical regression models to model and predict software defects and development effort. Global models are trained on the whole dataset. In contrast, local models are trained on subsets of the dataset. Last, we build a global model that takes into account local characteristics of the data. We evaluate the performance of these three approaches in a case study on two defect and two effort datasets. We find that for both types of data, local models show a significantly increased fit to the data compared to global models. The substantial improvements in both relative and absolute prediction errors demonstrate that this increased goodness of fit is valuable in practice. Finally, our experiments suggest that trends obtained from global models are too general for practical recommendations. At the same time, local models provide a multitude of trends which are only valid for specific subsets of the data. Instead, we advocate the use of trends obtained from global models that take into account local characteristics, as they combine the best of both worlds.},

abstract = {Context: Software defect prediction studies usually built models using within-company data, but very few focused on the prediction models trained with cross-company data. It is difficult to employ these models which are built on the within-company data in practice, because of the lack of these local data repositories. Recently, transfer learning has attracted more and more attention for building classifier in target domain using the data from related source domain. It is very useful in cases when distributions of training and test instances differ, but is it appropriate for cross-company software defect prediction? Objective: In this paper, we consider the cross-company defect prediction scenario where source and target data are drawn from different companies. In order to harness cross company data, we try to exploit the transfer learning method to build faster and highly effective prediction model. Method: Unlike the prior works selecting training data which are similar from the test data, we proposed a novel algorithm called Transfer Naive Bayes (TNB), by using the information of all the proper features in training data. Our solution estimates the distribution of the test data, and transfers cross-company data information into the weights of the training data. On these weighted data, the defect prediction model is built. Results: This article presents a theoretical analysis for the comparative methods, and shows the experiment results on the data sets from different organizations. It indicates that TNB is more accurate in terms of AUC (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), within less runtime than the state of the art methods. Conclusion: It is concluded that when there are too few local training data to train good classifiers, the useful knowledge from different-distribution training data on feature level may help. We are optimistic that our transfer learning method can guide optimal resource allocation strategies, which may reduce software testing cost and increase effectiveness of software testing process. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Reliably predicting software defects is one of the holy grails of software engineering. Researchers have devised and implemented a plethora of defect/bug prediction approaches varying in terms of accuracy, complexity and the input data they require. However, the absence of an established benchmark makes it hard, if not impossible, to compare approaches. We present a benchmark for defect prediction, in the form of a publicly available dataset consisting of several software systems, and provide an extensive comparison of well-known bug prediction approaches, together with novel approaches we devised. We evaluate the performance of the approaches using different performance indicators: classification of entities as defect-prone or not, ranking of the entities, with and without taking into account the effort to review an entity. We performed three sets of experiments aimed at (1) comparing the approaches across different systems, (2) testing whether the differences in performance are statistically significant, and (3) investigating the stability of approaches across different learners. Our results indicate that, while some approaches perform better than others in a statistically significant manner, external validity in defect prediction is still an open problem, as generalizing results to different contexts/learners proved to be a partially unsuccessful endeavor.},

abstract = {Software defect information, including links between bugs and committed changes, plays an important role in software maintenance such as measuring quality and predicting defects. Usually, the links are automatically mined from change logs and bug reports using heuristics such as searching for specific keywords and bug IDs in change logs. However, the accuracy of these heuristics depends on the quality of change logs. Bird et al. found that there are many missing links due to the absence of bug references in change logs. They also found that the missing links lead to biased defect information, and it affects defect prediction performance. We manually inspected the explicit links, which have explicit bug IDs in change logs and observed that the links exhibit certain features. Based on our observation, we developed an automatic link recovery algorithm, ReLink, which automatically learns criteria of features from explicit links to recover missing links. We applied ReLink to three open source projects. ReLink reliably identified links with 89{\%} precision and 78{\%} recall on average, while the traditional heuristics alone achieve 91{\%} precision and 64{\%} recall. We also evaluated the impact of recovered links on software maintainability measurement and defect prediction, and found the results of ReLink yields significantly better accuracy than those of traditional heuristics. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Background: This paper describes an analysisthat was conducted on newly collected repository with 92 versions of 38 proprietary, open-source and academic projects. A preliminary perfomed before showed the need for a further in-depth analysis study in order to identify project clusters. Aims: The goal of this research is to perform clustering on software projects in order to identify groups of software projects with similar characteristic from the defect prediction point of view. One defect prediction model should work well for all projects that belong to such group. The existence of those groups was investigated with statistical tests and by comparing the mean value of prediction efficiency. Method: Hierarchical and k-means clustering, as well obtained clusters were investigated with as Kohonen's neural network was used to find groups of similar projects. The the discriminant analysis. For each of the identified group a statistical analysis has been conducted in order to distinguish whether this group really exists. Two defect prediction models were created for each of the identified groups. The first one was based on the projects that belong to a given group, and the second one - on all the projects. Then, both models were applied to all versions of projects from the investigated group. If the predictions from the model based on projects that belong to the identified group are significantly better than the all-projects model (the mean values were compared and statistical tests were used), we conclude that the group really exists. Results: Six different clusters were identified and the existence of two of them was statistically proven: 1) cluster proprietary B – T=19, p=0.035, r=0.40; 2) cluster proprietary/open – t(17)=3.18, p=0.05, r=0.59. The obtained effect sizes (r) represent large effects according to Cohen's benchmark, which is a substantial finding. Conclusions: The two identified clusters were described and compared with results obtained by other researchers. The results of this work makes next step towards defining formal methods of reuse defect prediction models by identifying groups of projects within which the same defect prediction model may be used. Furthermore, a method of clustering was suggested and applied.},

Likewise, replications rely upon accurate reporting and using the same rather than similar versions of datasets. In recent years, there has been much interest in using machine learners to classify software modules into defect-prone and not defect-prone categories. The publicly available NASA datasets have been extensively used as part of this research. Objective--This short note investigates the extent to which published analyses based on the NASA defect datasets are meaningful and comparable. Method--We analyze the five studies published in the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering since 2007 that have utilized these datasets and compare the two versions of the datasets currently in use. Results--We find important differences between the two versions of the datasets, implausible values in one dataset and generally insufficient detail documented on dataset preprocessing. Conclusions--It is recommended that researchers 1) indicate the provenance of the datasets they use, 2) report any preprocessing in sufficient detail to enable meaningful replication, and 3) invest effort in understanding the data prior to applying machine learners.},

@article{lessmann08,
abstract = {Software defect prediction strives to improve software quality and testing efficiency by constructing predictive classification models from code attributes to enable a timely identification of fault-prone modules. Several classification models have been evaluated for this task. However, due to inconsistent findings regarding the superiority of one classifier over another and the usefulness of metric-based classification in general, more research is needed to improve convergence across studies and further advance confidence in experimental results. We consider three potential sources for bias: comparing classifiers over one or a small number of proprietary data sets, relying on accuracy indicators that are conceptually inappropriate for software defect prediction and cross-study comparisons, and, finally, limited use of statistical testing procedures to secure empirical findings. To remedy these problems, a framework for comparative software defect prediction experiments is proposed and applied in a large-scale empirical comparison of 22 classifiers over 10 public domain data sets from the NASA Metrics Data repository. Overall, an appealing degree of predictive accuracy is observed, which supports the view that metric-based classification is useful. However, our results indicate that the importance of the particular classification algorithm may be less than previously assumed since no significant performance differences could be detected among the top 17 classifiers.},

abstract = {Due to the tremendous complexity and sophistication of software, improving software reliability is an enormously difficult task. We study the software defect prediction problem, which focuses on predicting which modules will experience a failure during operation. Numerous studies have applied machine learning to software defect prediction; however, skewness in defect-prediction datasets usually undermines the learning algorithms. The resulting classifiers will often never predict the faulty minority class. This problem is well known in machine learning and is often referred to as learning from unbalanced datasets. We examine stratification, a widely used technique for learning unbalanced data that has received little attention in software defect prediction. Our experiments are focused on the SMOTE technique, which is a method of over-sampling minority-class examples. Our goal is to determine if SMOTE can improve recognition of defect-prone modules, and at what cost. Our experiments demonstrate that after SMOTE resampling, we have a more balanced classification. We found an improvement of at least 23{\%} in the average geometric mean classification accuracy on four benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally rep- resented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting)example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (nor- mal)class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal)class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of ourmethod of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC)and the ROC convex hull strategy},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.
